Revision history for Perl extension Digest::SHA3.

0.07  Sat Mar  9 17:36:14 MST 2013
	- untweaked Makefile.PL to remove dependencies of SHA3.c
		-- dependencies were breaking builds on VMS
		-- retaining dependencies provides too little benefit
			for cost of portable workaround

0.06  Mon Mar  4 08:12:04 MST 2013
	- removed code for standalone C operation (no longer used)
		-- eliminates need for external symbols
		-- reduces size of object files
		-- thanks to Marc Lehmann for suggestions
	- tweaked Makefile.PL to show dependencies of SHA3.c

0.05  Thu Jan 24 04:54:14 MST 2013
	- accommodated Unicode string input
		-- by using SvPVbyte instead of SvPV in SHA3.xs
			-- provided workaround for Perl 5.6
		-- added new test script t/unicode.t
	- provided documentation to describe Unicode handling
	- obtained slight speedup on Intel/gcc
		-- by setting -O1 and -fomit-frame-pointer
	- adopted (from Digest::SHA) workaround for DEC compiler bug

0.04  Sun Nov 11 19:20:06 MST 2012
	- enhanced performance
		-- typically 10-15% faster than 0.03
		-- code is still easy to read and modify
	- filled in a few documentation omissions

0.03  Mon Oct 29 04:01:06 MST 2012
	- attained a 2.5x performance increase through loop unrolling
		-- code is still easy to follow
			-- clearly traceable to Keccak pseudo code

0.02  Thu Oct 25 19:18:58 MST 2012
	- original version: adapted from Digest::SHA version 5.72
