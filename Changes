Revision history for Perl extension Digest::SHA3.

0.21  Fri May 16 10:21:46 MST 2014
	- restored original 'addfile' for use on opened file handles
		-- allows callbacks in place of actual files
			-- ref. IO::Callback (rt.cpan.org #95643)
	- re-established inheritance from Digest::base
		-- to pick up future Digest enhancements automatically
	- cleaned up documentation

0.20  Wed May  7 07:57:10 MST 2014
	- consolidated all dynamic memory allocation into XSUBs
		-- streamlines referencing of SHA3 objects
		-- simplifies DESTROYing of objects
	- enhanced Makefile.PL to allow 'use warnings'
		-- automatically reverts to $^W for early Perls
	- scrubbed C and Perl code to remove all compiler warnings

0.12  Sat Apr 19 05:14:50 MST 2014
	- added universal newlines mode ("U") to addfile and sha3sum
		-- based on Python Universal Newlines concept
			-- newlines identical across MacOS, DOS, and UNIX
		-- will deprecate portable mode ("p") in future
			-- "U" mode is cleaner and more efficient
	- enhanced performance
		-- reduced number of dynamic memory allocations
		-- sped up addfile method with use of C code
			-- ref. SHA3.xs (_addfilebin and _addfileuniv)
	- changed text file test (-T) to act on filehandles
		-- improves consistency when reading from STDIN
		-- still must act on filenames for early Perls (< 5.6)
	- sealed memory leak in SHA3.xs
		-- arose only with SvPVbyte exceptions during eval
	- patched inheritence bug (ref: rt.cpan.org #94830)
		-- use sv_isobject/sv_derived_from instead of sv_isa
	- added 'allocated' flag to SHA3 structure (ref. src/sha3.h)
		-- to guard against Perl double frees

0.11  Mon Feb 17 16:42:04 MST 2014
	- tightened code in SHA3.xs
		-- added sv_isa checks when invoking methods

0.10  Thu Jan 30 08:24:30 MST 2014
	- improved the performance of hexadecimal output functions
		-- ref. 'shahex' in src/sha3.c
		-- thanks to Thomas Drugeon for ideas and test script

0.09  Sun Jan  5 19:08:32 MST 2014
	- added a 'squeeze' method for SHA3-0 objects
		-- to construct SHA3-0 digests of any desired length

0.08  Wed Jun 26 04:32:06 MST 2013
	- workaround for repeated calls to shaclose
		-- ref. Bug #86295 (posted at Digest::SHA)
		-- need to explicitly reset internal pointer to NULL
			ref. shaclose() in SHA3.xs
	- corrected typos in sha3sum script
		-- ref. Bug #85430 (posted at Digest::SHA)

0.07  Sat Mar  9 17:36:14 MST 2013
	- untweaked Makefile.PL to remove dependencies of SHA3.c
		-- dependencies were breaking builds on VMS
		-- retaining dependencies provides too little benefit
			for cost of portable workaround

0.06  Mon Mar  4 08:12:04 MST 2013
	- removed code for standalone C operation (no longer used)
		-- eliminates need for external symbols
		-- reduces size of object files
		-- thanks to Marc Lehmann for suggestions
	- tweaked Makefile.PL to show dependencies of SHA3.c

0.05  Thu Jan 24 04:54:14 MST 2013
	- accommodated Unicode string input
		-- by using SvPVbyte instead of SvPV in SHA3.xs
			-- provided workaround for Perl 5.6
		-- added new test script t/unicode.t
	- provided documentation to describe Unicode handling
	- obtained slight speedup on Intel/gcc
		-- by setting -O1 and -fomit-frame-pointer
	- adopted (from Digest::SHA) workaround for DEC compiler bug

0.04  Sun Nov 11 19:20:06 MST 2012
	- enhanced performance
		-- typically 10-15% faster than 0.03
		-- code is still easy to read and modify
	- filled in a few documentation omissions

0.03  Mon Oct 29 04:01:06 MST 2012
	- attained a 2.5x performance increase through loop unrolling
		-- code is still easy to follow
			-- clearly traceable to Keccak pseudo code

0.02  Thu Oct 25 19:18:58 MST 2012
	- original version: adapted from Digest::SHA version 5.72
