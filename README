Digest::SHA3 version 0.01
=========================

Digest::SHA3 is a complete implementation of the NIST SHA-3 cryptographic
hash function, known originally as Keccak.  It gives Perl programmers
a convenient way to calculate SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and
SHA3-512 message digests, as well as variable-length hashes using the
SHA3-0 variant.  The module can handle all types of input, including
partial-byte data.

Digest::SHA3 is written in C for speed.  If your platform lacks a C
compiler, perhaps you can find the module in a binary form compatible
with your particular processor and operating system.

The initial version of Digest::SHA3 was written to emphasize simplicity
and correctness.  It passes all 12805 known-answer-tests for short
and long messages.  No particular emphasis was placed on performance.
However, future versions will endeavor to perform on a par with optimized
portable implementations.

The module omits all HMAC-SHA-3 functions until such time as official
test vectors become available.

The tests subdirectory (t/*.t) contains a set of test vectors compiled
from both official and informal sources.
